# Human-Detection-using-Hog-Feature

The Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor widely used in computer vision to extract features from image data for the purpose of object detection. Our objective for this project is to write a program to compute the HOG feature from an input image and then classify the HOG feature vector into Human or No-human by using a 3-nearest neighbor (NN) classifier.
